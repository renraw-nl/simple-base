# Simple Base

A few modules to build a personal project on:
* log; build on structlog and python-json-logger
* tempfile; Context decorator to create a temp folder and files, removed at the end
* timer; Timer decorator to log the duration a part of the code took.
* debug; Function decorator printing arguments and results for a wrapped method.


## ToDo
Add:
* Config; to have a simple way to handle config (dotenv, toml)
* Documentation
* Tests
